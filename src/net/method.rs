/// Trait describing an HTTP method which is allowed to have a body.
///
/// ### Motivation
/// Though not forbidden in the HTTP spec, `GET` and `DELETE` requests are generally not
/// meant to have bodies, and it is recommended for servers to ignore bodies on such
/// requests ([IETF RFC 2616 (HTTP 1.1 Spec), Section 4.3][rfc2616-4.3]).
///
/// Thus, this trait acts as a strongly typed anti-footgun for when you specified a
/// `GET` or `DELETE` request when you actually meant `POST` or `PUT` or `PATCH`.
///
/// If you must have a body on a `GET` or `DELETE` request, you can use the
/// `force_body!()` macro to override this protection.
///
/// [rfc2616-4.3]: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-4.3
